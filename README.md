# HTML Pricing Table

This is a simple pricing table project I built completely on my own. I didnâ€™t follow any tutorial â€” I just had an idea in my mind and tried to bring it to life using only HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- CSS Grid  
- Google Fonts  
- Font Awesome Icons  
- Responsive Design  

## ðŸ’¡ About This Project

The goal was to practice layout techniques and build something clean and functional. I used CSS Grid for the layout and added a few visual touches like icons and fonts to make it more appealing.

This is one of the projects Iâ€™m doing as part of my frontend learning journey. More to come soon!

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

Just download or clone the repo, then open `index.html` in your browser.
